# Website Objective

Based on the content and structure of the `docs` folder, particularly `index.md`, the primary objective of this website is to function as a **Digital Garden**.

It is a personal and public space for the author, a Software Engineer, to:

1.  **Document and Share Learning:** Chronicle their journey and work, with a current focus on Python, AI Agents, and the surrounding ecosystem.
2.  **Explore Engineering Philosophy:** Reflect on software development practices, particularly the balance between rapid feature delivery and long-term code quality and maintainability.
3.  **Organize Knowledge:** Maintain two distinct streams of content:
    *   **`/var/log/` (The Blog):** A personal log for reflections, thoughts, career updates, book notes, and informal technical musings. It's presented in a narrative, personal style.
    *   **`~/.notes/` (The Wiki):** A collection of structured, evergreen notes and documentation on specific languages, tools, and concepts.
4.  **Showcase Projects:** Briefly document personal projects and experiments in "The Lab."

The overall theme is one of continuous learning, deep technical exploration, and personal reflection on a career in software engineering. The site is not just a portfolio, but an active "work-in-progress" repository of knowledge.
