# Writing Style Observations

Based on analysis of provided blog posts (e.g., `2025-recap.md`, `monolith-to-microservices.md`), the user's preferred writing style is characterized by:

-   **Personal and Reflective Tone:** Content is often framed from a first-person perspective, sharing personal experiences, insights, and feelings related to the topic. This creates a relatable and engaging narrative.
-   **Extensive Use of Metaphors and Analogies:** Complex technical concepts are frequently explained or enhanced through vivid metaphors and analogies (e.g., "Jenga tower," "spaghetti to lasagna," "weapons to fight a war," "metaphorical sunglasses"). These add color and make abstract ideas more concrete.
-   **Narrative-Driven Structure:** Posts often follow a storytelling arc, presenting challenges, evolutions, and resolutions, even when discussing technical subjects or book reviews.
-   **Honesty and Self-Awareness:** There's an openness about struggles, challenges (e.g., burnout, technical debt), and personal tendencies (e.g., over-building, getting lost in complexities). This lends authenticity to the writing.
-   **Engaging and Vivid Language:** The use of descriptive and strong verbs/adjectives makes the prose lively and impactful.
-   **Connection of Technical to Personal:** Technical discussions are consistently tied back to personal impact, career development, or individual learning journeys.
-   **Subtle Humor:** A dash of self-aware or understated humor occasionally surfaces, adding personality to the text.
