# Hello, I'm Mike Myat Min Han

I am a Software Engineer based in the UK, currently building **AI Interview Agents** at **Indeed**. 

This space serves as an evolving **Digital Garden** and **Link Log**—a work-in-progress repository for my engineering notes, technical deep dives, and curated links.

## ⚡ What I'm Working On

### 👨‍💻 Professional Focus
* **Settling into Python:** After years with other stacks, I have transitioned to Python and am deep-diving into the Python ecosystem, specifically around **AI Agents**.
* **Engineering Philosophy:** I advocate for "clean code as long-term velocity." I'm currently exploring patterns to reduce friction between rapid feature delivery and technical debt.
* **AI Integration:** Experimenting with LLMs for practical engineering workflows (and trying to determine when *not* to use them).

### 🧪 The Lab

- **`voyager`** My homelab to learn more about `k8s` and `docker`.
- **`hubble-l`** My ubuntu box for local LLMs and other experiments.
- **`resilience-loop`** An attempt at learning more about `FastAPI`, `react`, `tailwind` and creating a web-based game.

## 🧩 Personal
When I'm not working, I am:

* ⚽ Suffering/Celebrating as an **Arsenal** fan.
* 🎮 Playing **Baby Steps**, **Sackboy: A Big Adventure**, **Dave the Diver** and of course, **Stardew Valley**.
* 🍿 Watching **Pluribus**, **My name is Earl** and curating new movies to watch.
* 📚 Growing my [goodreads library](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6297425-mike-han)
* 👨‍👩‍👧 Teaching my daughter how to code via *Code.org*.

!!! quote "Current Philosophy"
    Value deep immersion over speed reading or LLM's summary. Better to understand one system deeply than skim ten surfaces.
