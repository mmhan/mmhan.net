# Hello, I'm Mike Myat Min Han

I am a Software Engineer based in the UK, currently building **AI Interview Agents** at **Indeed**. 

This space serves as an evolving **Digital Garden** and **Link Log**—a work-in-progress repository for my engineering notes, technical deep dives, and curated links.

It serves as my external brain for engineering notes, interesting links I find, and occasional deep dives into system design.

## ⚡ What I'm Working On

### 👨‍💻 Professional Focus
* **Transitioning to Python:** After years with other stacks, I have transitioned to Python and am deep-diving into the Python ecosystem, specifically around **AI Agents**.
* **Engineering Philosophy:** I advocate for "clean code as long-term velocity." I'm currently exploring patterns to reduce friction between rapid feature delivery and technical debt.
* **AI Integration:** Experimenting with LLMs for practical engineering workflows (and trying to determine when *not* to use them).

## 🧩 Personal
When I'm not working, I am:

* ⚽ Suffering/Celebrating as an **Arsenal** fan.
* 🎮 Playing **Baby Steps**, **Sackboy: A Big Adventure**, **Dave the Diver** and of course, **Stardew Valley** on either the PS5 or the PC `hubble`.
* 🛠 Tinkering with `voyager` (my homelab) and `hubble-l` (my ubuntu box), for fun.
* 👨‍👩‍👧 Teaching my daughter how to code via *Code.org*.

!!! quote "Current Philosophy"
    Value deep immersion over speed reading. Better to understand one system deeply than skim ten surfaces.
