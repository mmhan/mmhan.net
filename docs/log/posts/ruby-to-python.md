# Switching to Python: Notes from a Ruby Developer

During the time I was away from blogging, I have been moved from **Indeed Flex** to **Indeed** and have started working with **Python** more which is quite a significant change to be honest.

<!-- more -->

I believe it came about as a result of my survey answer to the question that goes something like "How proficient are you at **Python**?". If I remembered correctly, I foolishly thought to myself, I have read (read="skimmed through") several **Python** beginner books and have done one or two projects; what's the worst that could happen if I choose `Intermediate` as my proficiency level.

Of course, when it dawned upon me that my work with **Ruby** will be reduced significantly and **Python** would be my daily driver, it took me nearly a month to recover from the shock. This transition marked a big shift in my career, given the fact that I've always identified myself as a **Rubyist** with ambitions of developing my skills further to be able to contribute as well as start my own open-source projects.

Having spent nearly 10 years working with **Ruby**, I was accustomed to the "Rails way" of development. Switching to **Python** initially felt like learning a new language both literally and figuratively.

**Ruby** and **Rails** had been my go-to language and framework for a long time. Its elegance, focus on developer happiness, and the conventions of **Rails** made development feel intuitive and enjoyable.

**Python**, on the other hand, brought a different flavor to programming. Its simplicity and readability stood out, but I quickly learned that simplicity doesn’t mean there aren’t new knives to avoid cutting myself.

Managing imports and organizing modules/files are something that I have never needed to do with **Ruby/Rails**. With **Rails**, every file represents a class that will be automatically imported once it's called into action.

With **Django** that holy commandment has been broken to pieces and one-class-belong-to-one-file rule is no longer applicable. That freedom and a curse threw me around a loop, leaving me struggling to regain my composure.

As I settled into **Python**, I was struck by the vast ecosystem of libraries and tools it offers, especially in fields like data analysis, data science, machine learning, and generative AI.

`Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` opens up new world of possibilities and opportunities that I have never thought of before.

Of course, every blog post these days have to mention **Generative AI**. Initially, I was reluctant about the trend, feeling it was overhyped. While that sentiment may still hold some truth, I decided it was worth exploring so I wouldn't miss out.

I used `OpenAI`'s Playground to get a feel for how APIs generate text, played with `LM Studio` to try out other models, and experimented with tools like `GPT4ALL` and etc.

*For example, while writing this post, I’m using `ChatGPT`’s canvas feature for the first time, and wrestling with it so that it writes like a person who doesn't have a stick up above their butt.*

As I continue my journey with **Python**, I’m quite excited about the opportunities it brings. My current focus is on deepening my knowledge of **Python**’s libraries for machine learning and **AI**, but I’m also looking forward to building projects that leverage these tools.

I’m also eager to see how this transition shapes my career. Moving into **Python** has broadened my skill set, but it’s also changed how I think about problem-solving and software development.

If you’re considering a similar transition or learning a new language, my advice is simple: embrace the challenge. Stepping out of your comfort zone is never easy, but it’s often where the most growth happens. **Python** may not be **Ruby**, but I’ve found it to be an incredible language in its own right. I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next.
